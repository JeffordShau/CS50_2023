Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: No preductions were incorect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call 100,000 simulations good enough because there is a huge time gap between 1,000,000 simulations and 100,000 simulations.
